## About
Bamazon lists products from a database to a user (customer). The customer may select an item and quantity to purchase. If there is sufficient inventory of the product, the purchase is recorded in the database and the customer is provided a total for the transaction. If there is insufficient inventory, the customer is notified and no order is placed.
